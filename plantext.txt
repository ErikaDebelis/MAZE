on pg 29 = the table is a door for 17

you must go through door 17 to solve the maze

the way to the center of the maze (pg 45) is not the same way to leave the maze(go back to pg 1)
the quickest way to the center(45) is only 7 steps
the quickest way back from the center is 9 steps.



potential hints if i get to said functionality:

the number of paths leading into or out of each room is equal to the number of doors. with only 1 exception; there is also an extra door in Room 39.

the way to the center of the maze (pg 45) is not the same way to leave the maze(go back to pg 1)




Riddle Hints:

one clue in Room 1 is that there are words written above each door: Tale, Story, Yarn and Fable. These words all appear in the story text (sometimes as anagrams, e.g. “Nary”) except the word Fable. This word appears above door 26, indicating that this is the correct door. Looking for odd items out is a relatively common feature of the puzzles in Maze.

the original deadline for solving the puzzle came and went, two sets of additional clues were published:

The first clue reads as follows and relates to the riddle in Room 45:
Three things should be thrown out;
Three things come in pairs.
You’ll find two people in the room;
They must sit in one chair.

The second set of 6 clues each applied to one word of the riddle in Room 45:
1.) I’ll tip my hat if the two of you can solve this.
2.) You can get into these two shoes only if you don’t go anywhere.
3.) You will find two names on the table, and they go together like doughnut and hole.
4.) You must choose between two pictures.
5.) There are no two ways you can read this sign.
6.) You can see that another two pictures demonstrate their own kind of symmetry.
