* 8:00: researching button options to change page/door- found html image maps! https://www.allsomedock.com/media/berserk/plugins/image_map/ https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YsvA0r3rI0
* 8:30: begin creating image maps using https://www.image-map.net/


im thinking about my function needed to change pages:
1. hide current img
2. show next img that corresponds with html image map clicked
3. make api call to database to get text 
EXTRA- BEYOND MVP
1.5 . log the room/page you're leaving in a window to see the moves you've made and rooms you've already been to
4. add animation to text 

will want it curried enough to make this usable for any page within the maze
