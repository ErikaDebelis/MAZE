They studied the old frescoes for clues but missed the obvious signs. 'Are we on the right path?' they asked. Keeping in mind what a relative term 'right' is, I assured them they were, indeed, on the right path. As for the 'correct' path or the 'most appropriate' path. . . Well, that might be something else. Full of confidence now they marched out to . . .",

Because no one wanted to stay here very long they missed the real sign while looking through the obvious. People in their situation, confronted with a challenge, tend to accept the terms of the challenge as a given, without examining it from all sides. How many sides does that problem have? They donâ€™t know. We passed down a long flight of stairs, through some sort of pantry, and on into . . .",

A small black cat ran out of a door to my right, sniffed at us, and, before I could move, ran out of the hall, It was fortunate that I was still standing with the rest of them or they might have noticed. Faint voices came down one of the corridors.'Shall we toss a coin?' I asked. 'Or have you made up your minds?' They hadn't made up their minds, and they had no coins. By a process of elimination they decided to go to . . .",

As this was an important decision I encouraged them to take their time. After all, the more they think about the possibilities the more choices they have to make, What were their chances of choosing wisely . . . one in four? Two in four perhaps, if I was generous about it. . . and why not be generous? There are one hundred ninety doors in this part of the House, counting the gate . . . enough for everyone. Making a choice, they entered a very long, dark corridor and at last came out into . . .",

Standing in the light one ofthem put his hand out. 'I think it may be raining out there . . .' They didn't like the look of the place. 'You continue to judge everything by the way it looks!' I cried, exasperated by their timidity. I knew I shouldn't have said anything. If you think of all the deceptions practiced in my family, particularly on my father . . .
